    "- `text`: The original word text.\n",

    "- `pos_`: The simple [UPOS](https://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/pos/) part-of-speech tag.\n",
    "- `tag_`: The detailed part-of-speech tag. (I *believe* these are the same tags used in the [Penn Treebank](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html), but I am not sure.) \n",
    "- `dep_`: Syntactic dependency, i.e. the relation between tokens.\n",
    "- `shape_`: The word shape â€“ capitalization, punctuation, digits.\n",
    "- `is_alpha`: Is the token an alpha character?\n",
    "- `is_punct`: Is the token a punctuation marker?\n",
    "- `is_stop`: Is the token part of a stop list, i.e. the most common words of the language?\n",

This is different from a simpler, though less accurate, rule-based method, e.g. splitting sentences wherever you find a `.`, `?`, or `!`. So this means that you need a statistical model to parse the text for the segmenting to work, which is why we load the model in before we do anything else.\n",

    "However, a model is only as good as the data it was trained on, and if your data is of a very different kind compared to the training data, your segmentation may not work so well. You may find that if you are working with certain kinds of data, e.g. conversational data or data from IM, chats or social media, the default model doesn't work so well. Fortunately, you can customize the segmentation process by adding your own rules to tell spaCy what to do in special cases. What rules you add will depend on the nature of your data.\n",
