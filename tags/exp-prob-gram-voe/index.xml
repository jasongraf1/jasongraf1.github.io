      <description>This is a multiyear (2013-2021) project funded by a Type II Odysseus grant awarded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) to the Principal Investigator (grant # G0C5913N, budget: â‚¬856,260).
Description of the Project The project is situated at the crossroads of research on English as a World Language, usage-based theoretical linguistics, variationist linguistics, and cognitive sociolinguistics. It specifically marries the spirit of the Probabilistic Grammar framework (which posits that grammatical knowledge is experience-based and partially probabilistic) to research along the lines of the English world-wide paradigm (which is concerned with the dialectology and sociolinguistics of post-colonial English-speaking communities around the world).</description>
