      <description>This is a multiyear (2013&amp;ndash;2021) project funded by a Type II Odysseus grant awarded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) to the Principal Investigator (grant # G0C5913N, budget: €856,260).
Description of the Project The project is situated at the crossroads of research on English as a World Language, usage-based theoretical linguistics, variationist linguistics, and cognitive sociolinguistics. It specifically marries the spirit of the Probabilistic Grammar framework (which posits that grammatical knowledge is experience-based and partially probabilistic) to research along the lines of the English world-wide paradigm (which is concerned with the dialectology and sociolinguistics of post-colonial English-speaking communities around the world).</description>

      <description>This is a multiyear (2018&amp;ndash;2021) project funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) (grant # G0D4618N, budget: €229,000).
Description of the Project Probabilistic grammars regulate the way in which we choose between different ways of saying the same thing. For example, in English people can say either Tom sent Mary a letter, or Tom sent a letter to Mary. Both syntactic variants have roughly the same meaning, and we know that variant choice is a function of precisely quantifiable effects of probabilistic factors such as the length of the theme, or the pronominality of the recipient.</description>
